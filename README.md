# Taelcore
Novel Dimensionality Reduction Technique

We present a new approach to predict the risk of acute cellular rejection (ACR)
after lung transplantation by using machine learning algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP) or Autoencoder (AE), and combining them with topological data analysis (TDA)
tools. Our proposed method, named topological autoencoder with best linear combination
for optimal reduction of embeddings (Taelcore), effectively reduces the dimensionality of
high-dimensional datasets and yields better results compared to other models. We validate
the effectiveness of Taelcore in reducing the prediction error rate on three datasets. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that Taelcoreâ€™s topological improvements have a positive effect on
the majority of the machine learning algorithms used. By providing a new way to diagnose
patients and detect complications early, this work contributes to improved clinical outcomes
in lung transplantation.
