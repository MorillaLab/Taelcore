# Taelcore
Novel Dimensionality Reduction Technique

We present a new approach to predict the risk of acute cellular rejection (ACR)
after lung transplantation by using machine learning algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP) or Autoencoder (AE), and combining them with topological data analysis (TDA)
tools. Our proposed method, named topological autoencoder with best linear combination
for optimal reduction of embeddings (Taelcore), effectively reduces the dimensionality of
high-dimensional datasets and yields better results compared to other models. We validate
the effectiveness of Taelcore in reducing the prediction error rate on three datasets. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that Taelcoreâ€™s topological improvements have a positive effect on
the majority of the machine learning algorithms used. By providing a new way to diagnose
patients and detect complications early, this work contributes to improved clinical outcomes
in lung transplantation.

A comprehensive evaluation of latent space representations is conducted, comparing our novel approach with baseline techniques - Autoencoder, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP - across diverse datasets. (a) Shapes Dataset: Our method's latent space representations, alongside those generated by Autoencoder, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, are presented. Our method not only adeptly preserves the intrinsic structure but also surpasses other techniques in separation, as evidenced by the distinct, well-separated clusters. (b) Iris Dataset: Latent space representations for the Iris dataset are showcased for our method, Autoencoder, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. Our approach achieves a notably more linear class separation, signifying its effectiveness in capturing crucial discriminative information. (c) Lung Transplantation Dataset: The latent space representations for the lung transplantation dataset are depicted, featuring our method, Autoencoder, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. Our method excels in achieving a substantial linear separation between ACR and non-ACR patient groups, all while maintaining a lower degree of sparsity compared to alternative techniques.
